# Cloud Concepts
**Cloud Computing**  
 use a network of remote severs to store, manage & process data.

 **Evolution of Cloud Computing**:  
 Dedicated Server ->  
 Virtual Private Server ->  
 Shared Hosting ->  
 Cloud Hosting

 Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994.

 AWS Amazon Web Services 2006  
 Simple Queue Serive (SQS) 2004  
 Simple Storage Service (S3) 2004  
 Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 2006

 **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)**  
 is a company that provide cloud services that are accessible via API.

 **Lanscape of CSPs**  
 Tier 1: AWS, GCP, Azure  
 Tier 2: IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud  
 Tier 3: Vultr, Digital Ocean, Akamai Connected Cloud  
 Tier 4: OpenStack, Apache CloudStack, Vmware vSphere

 **Magic Quadrant (MQ)**  
 a series of market research reports to demonstrate market trends.

 **4 Most Common Cloud Services**  
 Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases

 **AWS Technology Overview**  
 Compute: EC2 Virtual Machines  
 Storage: EBS Virtual Hard Drives  
 Database: RDS SQL Databases  
 Networking (and content delivery): VPC Privaate Cloud Networking

 **Evolution of Computing**  
 Dedicated ->  
 VMs (Hypervisor) ->  
 Containers (Docker Deamon) ->  
 Functions (Serverless Compute)

 **Types of Cloud Computing**  
 SaaS (Software as a Service): a product that is run & managed by the service provider.  
 PaaS (Platform as a Service): Focus on deployment & management of your apps  
 IaaSS (Infrastructure as a Service): The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers & data storage spcae.

 **CLoud Computing Deployment Models**  
 Public Cloud (Cloud Native / Cloud First)  
 Private Cloud (On-Premise) could be OpenStack  
 Hybrid (Using both On-Premise and A Cloud Service Provider)  
 Cross-Cloud (Using Multiple CLoud Providers)

# Digital Transformation
## Innovation Waves
Kondratiev Waves (aka Innovation Waves / K-waves) are hypoothesized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy. This phenomenon is closely connected with Technology life cycles.

A common pattern of a wave change of **supply** and **demand**:  
Expansion -> Boom -> Recession -> Depression

## Burning Platform
Burning Platform is a terms used when ***a company abandons old technology for new technology*** with the <u> uncertainty of success and can be motivated by fear</u> that the organization future survival hinges on its **digital transformation**

## Evolution of Computing Power
Computing Power: The throughput measured at which a computer can complete a computational task

General Computing, GPU Computing, Quantum Computing

Elastic Compute Cloud ECS, AWS Inferentiare (Inf1), AWS Brackeet (Via CalTech)
